# Evidence-Drop-off-Point
A simple script to add a location for players to drop off items (weapons) they have collected from peds/players during the game. This adds RP instead of just using vmenu to remove weapons. 

I could ask for credit here, but this is just a contribution as I work to improve my coding skills.

The locations are set for my FivePD server. The blip ID's are generic, adjust as you need.
